O Most Blessed Mother,
Heart of Love, heart of mercy,
Ever listening, caring, consoling, hear our prayer.
As your children, we implore your intercession with Jesus your Son.
Receive with understanding and compassion the petitions we place before you today especially the complete healing of Grace and the complete protection of Katelynâ€™s health.
We are comforted in knowing your heart is ever open to those who ask for your prayer.
We trust to your gentle care and intercession those whom we love and who are sick or lonely or hurting.
Help all of us, Holy Mother to bear our burdens in this life until we may share eternal life and peace with God forever. 

</body>
