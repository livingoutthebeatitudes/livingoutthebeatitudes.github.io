  <h3>Prayer to Father Francis Xavier Truong Buu Diep</h3><br><br>

  O God, almighty and merciful! Dear Father Francis Xavier! <br>
  When you were living among us, you loved people around you and all who were coming to you for help. <br>
  We believe that you are now very close to the merciful Lord whom
  you loved so much as a disciple and as a priest among your people.<br>
  We turn to you in prayer, especially for these intentions that we mention in our hearts... (silent private prayer).<br>
  We seek to find happiness in living as you did, in loving our sisters and brothers and in trusting in your love for us all.<br>
  We pray this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen<br><br>

  <h3>Prayer for the beatification of the servant of God, Father Francis Xavier Truong buu Diep</h3>
  O Almighty and eternal God. We thank you for giving the Church of Viet Nam <br>
  a great shepherd in the person of Father Francis Xavier Truong Buu Diep.<br>
  As a Christian, he lived as a true son of yours the call given to the children of God;<br>
  his faith was strong always, his hope was firm, his love was generous towards all people.<br><br>

  As a priest, Father Francis made visible in the Church the presence of Christ your Son by laying down his own
  life <br>
  so that his people may have the abundant life offered by our Savior;<br>
  As an Apostolic missionary, Father Francis was interested in evangelization through the Divine Mercy<br>
  shown by his love for the poor, the sick and the sinners,<br>
  and especially his prayer for the gentiles, begging you, Lord, to pour out your grace upon them.<br>
  His openness to their conversion invited so many to come to him for help.<br> <br>
  We ask you, Almighty and eternal God, to grant us your blessings through the prayers <br>
  we offer you by the intercession of Father Francis, especially what we mention to you in our hearts..... <br>
  Kindly increase our hope of seeing soon the day on which the one we love and honor will be glorified among the saints in heaven.<br><br>
