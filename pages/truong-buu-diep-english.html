  <h3>Prayer to Father Francis Xavier Truong Buu Diep</h3><br><br>

  <p>
  O God, almighty and merciful! Dear Father Francis Xavier!
  When you were living among us, you loved people around you and all who were coming to you for help.
  We believe that you are now very close to the merciful Lord whom
  you loved so much as a disciple and as a priest among your people.
  We turn to you in prayer, especially for these intentions that we mention in our hearts... (silent private prayer).
  We seek to find happiness in living as you did, in loving our sisters and brothers and in trusting in your love for us all.
  We pray this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen
  </p>

  <h3>Prayer for the beatification of the servant of God, Father Francis Xavier Truong buu Diep</h3>
  <p>
  O Almighty and eternal God. We thank you for giving the Church of Viet Nam
  a great shepherd in the person of Father Francis Xavier Truong Buu Diep.
  As a Christian, he lived as a true son of yours the call given to the children of God;
  his faith was strong always, his hope was firm, his love was generous towards all people.
</p>
<p>
  As a priest, Father Francis made visible in the Church the presence of Christ your Son by laying down his own
  life
  so that his people may have the abundant life offered by our Savior;
  As an Apostolic missionary, Father Francis was interested in evangelization through the Divine Mercy
  shown by his love for the poor, the sick and the sinners,
  and especially his prayer for the gentiles, begging you, Lord, to pour out your grace upon them.
  His openness to their conversion invited so many to come to him for help.
</p>

<p>
  We ask you, Almighty and eternal God, to grant us your blessings through the prayers
  we offer you by the intercession of Father Francis, especially what we mention to you in our hearts.....
  Kindly increase our hope of seeing soon the day on which the one we love and honor will be glorified among the saints in heaven.
