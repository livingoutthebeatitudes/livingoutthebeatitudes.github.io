    Queen of the Holy Rosary, be gracious to baby Grace, restore her to health.<br>
    We beg you to run to Jesus and ask him to move heaven and earth to bring about this intention.<br>
    We know that her life is in His hands, that He is forming her at this very moment,<br>
    and when two or more are gathered, that He hears our cry and petition.<br>
    We ask for the protection of body and soul for Katelyn and Stephen through this trying time,<br>
    and for Katelyn to have a safe delivery.<br>
    His kingdom come, His will be done.<br><br>
    Amen.<br>
</p>
