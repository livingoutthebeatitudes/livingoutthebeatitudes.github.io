      O marvelous wonder of the Church, seraphic virgin, Saint Catherine, <br>
      because of your extraordinary virtue and the immense good which you <br>
      accomplished for the Church and society, you are acclaimed and blessed by <br>
      all people. O blessed Catherine, turn your benign countenance towards me, <br>
      who confident of your powerful patronage call upon you with all the ardor <br>
      of affection and I beg you to obtain by your prayers the favors I so <br>
      ardently desire (mention your request). <br><br>

      You, who were a victim of charity, <br>
      who in order to benefit your neighbor obtained from God the most <br>
      stupendous miracles and became the joy and the hope of all; you cannot <br>
      help but hear the prayers of those who fly to you heart, that heart which <br>
      you received from the Divine Redeemer in a celestial ecstasy. <br><br>

      O seraphic virgin, show once again proof of your power and of your flaming charity, <br>
      so that your name shall ever be blessed and exalted; grant that we, having <br>
      experienced your most efficacious intercession here on earth, may come one <br>
      day to thank you in Heaven and enjoy eternal happiness with you. Amen. <br>
