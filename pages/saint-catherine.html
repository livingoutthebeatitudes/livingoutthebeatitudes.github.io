      O marvelous wonder of the Church, seraphic virgin, Saint Catherine,
      because of your extraordinary virtue
      and the immense good which you accomplished for the Church and society,
      you are acclaimed and blessed by all people.
      O blessed Catherine, turn your benign countenance towards me,
      who confident of your powerful patronage call upon you
      with all the ardor of affection
      and I beg you to obtain by your prayers the favors
      I so ardently desire (mention your request).
    </p>
    <p>
      You, who were a victim of charity,
      who in order to benefit your neighbor obtained from God the most
      stupendous miracles and became the joy and the hope of all; you cannot
      help but hear the prayers of those who fly to your heart, that heart which
      you received from the Divine Redeemer in a celestial ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      O seraphic virgin, show once again proof of your power and of your flaming charity,
      so that your name shall ever be blessed and exalted; grant that we, having
      experienced your most efficacious intercession here on earth, may come one
      day to thank you in Heaven and enjoy eternal happiness with you. Amen.
